# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized TOR Usage
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/richardrance0/Threat_Hunting_Scenarios/blob/main/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-event-creation.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Tor Browser

##  Scenario

Management suspects that some employees may be using TOR browsers to bypass network security controls because recent network logs show unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of employees discussing ways to access restricted sites during work hours. The goal is to detect any TOR usage and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks. If any use of TOR is found, notify management.

### High-Level TOR-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceFileEvents`** for any `tor(.exe)` or `firefox(.exe)` file events.
- **Check `DeviceProcessEvents`** for any signs of installation or usage.
- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for any signs of outgoing connections over known TOR ports.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceFileEvents` Table

Searched the DeviceFileEvents table for any file with “tor” in it. It appears that the user “theeRick” on DeviceName of “WinRichStigInte”downloaded a tor installer that generated tor-related activity and a file called “tor-shopping-list.txt” was downloaded to the desktop. These events began at 2025-05-30T02:07:36.8356006Z.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName contains "WinRichStigInte"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName == "theerick"
| where FileName contains "tor"
| where Timestamp >= datetime(2025-05-30T02:07:36.8356006Z)
| order by Timestamp desc 
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, filename = FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, Account = InitiatingProcessAccountName

```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

Searched the DeviceProcessEvents table for the process "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.3.ex.  On May 29, 2025, at 9:07 PM, a user named "theerick" on the computer "winrichstiginte" initiated the execution of the Tor Browser installer (version 14.5.3) from their Downloads folder. The file, named "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.3.exe," has a SHA256 hash of 3b7e78a4ccc935cfe71a0e4d41cc297d48a44e722b4a46f73b5562aed9c1d2ea, confirming its authenticity as the official release from the Tor Project .

This action indicates that the user was setting up the Tor Browser, a tool designed to enhance online privacy and anonymity by routing internet traffic through a global network of servers. The portable version chosen allows the browser to run without installation, offering flexibility for use across different systems.

Given the legitimate source and the verified hash, this installation appears to be a standard setup of the Tor Browser for privacy-focused browsing.


**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName contains "WinRichStigInte"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.3.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256,
ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp desc

```

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table for TOR Browser Execution

Searched for any indication that user "employee" actually opened the TOR browser. There was evidence that they did open it at `2024-11-08T22:17:21.6357935Z`. There were several other instances of `firefox.exe` (TOR) as well as `tor.exe` spawned afterwards.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where FileName has_any ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "tor-browser.exe")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine  
| order by Timestamp desc
```

---

### 4. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table for TOR Network Connections

Searched for any indication the TOR browser was used to establish a connection using any of the known TOR ports. At `2024-11-08T22:18:01.1246358Z`, an employee on the "threat-hunt-lab" device successfully established a connection to the remote IP address `176.198.159.33` on port `9001`. The connection was initiated by the process `tor.exe`, located in the folder `c:\users\employee\desktop\tor browser\browser\torbrowser\tor\tor.exe`. There were a couple of other connections to sites over port `443`.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents  
| where DeviceName == "threat-hunt-lab"  
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName != "system"  
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe")  
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9040", "9050", "9051", "9150", "80", "443")  
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath  
| order by Timestamp desc
```
